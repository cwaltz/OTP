# OTP Code Challenge

**Note 1: The contents of this file and repository may change (for the better) in next few days.**

**Note 2: This project (the quality of code and result) is in no way the reflection of the kind of software engineer I am or aspire to be. Instead, it reflects my inexperience with Python, Django, HTML, et al.**

### Project: SF Movies

#### Problem Statement:
Create a service that shows on a map where movies have been filmed in San Francisco. The user should be able to filter the view using autocompletion search.

The data is available on [DataSF](http://www.datasf.org/): [Film Locations](https://data.sfgov.org/Arts-Culture-and-Recreation-/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am).

#### Solution:
Using Django and Python. I chose it over other web frameworks because it is the preferred choice of OpenTable team.

Visit [SF Movies](https://mysfmovies.herokuapp.com/) to have a look at the app *(beta version)*. Hovering over the marker will display the details in **Movie-Title (Release-Year) @ Location-Name** format. Feel free to suggest improvements or to simply have a chat with me (anighadge@yahoo.com).

1. This project is developed on windows 7. I am not sure what changes one needs to make to make it work on other platforms. In any case, feel free to approach me.
2. Make sure that you have installed [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) and [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).
